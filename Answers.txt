A1) One reason we may want to delimit using '<|>' is that it is a very uncommon sequence of symbols that is unlikely to appear in real data.
This lets us safely parse data without having to worry about interfering with the actual data.  It also makes it easy to distinguish where one
entry starts and the other ends.  Perhaps it is convenient to have '<>' in resulting parses, such as for an HTML attribute.

A2) See KeybankParse.py  -- I may have misunderstood what it means to delimit by '|' and how the format should look.

A3) See IPAddrParse.py -- If I had more time, I would do some research on socket.inet_aton() to make sure it does indeed verify IP addresses based on IANA standards

A4) See IPAddrParse2.py -- Again, I'm not sure I understood perfectly how you want it to be parsed, let me know if you'd like me to make a change.
